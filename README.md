# Irc MusicBot

The MusicBot can be used to control spotify running on a computer via irc. The bot will join a channel and listen to commands. Right now you can skip to the next song or play the previous song. You can also control the system volume.


## How to install MusicBot

### Requirements
The MusicBot requires python and the python-twisted package to be installed on your machine. You will obviously also need spotify to run on the same machine. Currently only ubunu has been tested. Windows is not supported.

### The installation
You can download the latest version of MusicBot from the downloads page on GitHub. When you have it downloaded you can edit the configfile and start the bot with the following command: python bot.py. If you do not want to store your password in a configfile you can remove it from the file and you will be asked to enter a password when you start the bot.
